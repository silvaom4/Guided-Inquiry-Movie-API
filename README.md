#Guided Inquiry Movie API 

Welcome to this weeks Guided Inquiry.

I was given the task of creating an application where a user could enter a movie and they would then receive a list of similar movies.

To access, navigate to the SRC folder, run the file named src.js

In the terminal, nodemon src.js

Once the port is running and open in the browser, you can now use the application.

Enter a movie and list of similar movies will be generated. 

Enjoy. 



Challenge is Below -----------



Node Challenge
Similar Movies 
By referring to the provided documentation at https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs, create an application that displays a list of movies similar to the one entered by the user. The application should allow the user to select a movie and then present a list of movies that share similarities with the selected movie. 
Make sure to thoroughly read and understand the documentation to implement this functionality successfully!
